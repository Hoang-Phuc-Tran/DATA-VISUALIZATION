## Overview
The objective of this assignment is to develop an application that creates a Pareto diagram. Pareto diagrams are crucial in various industries for analyzing defects. This assignment offers some flexibility in the user interface design.

## Requirements
- **Application Development:**
  1. The application can be developed on any Microsoft platform. Desktop platforms (WinForms or WPF) are recommended for ease of use, but the choice is yours. The code-behind must be in C#.
  2. The Pareto diagram must include:
     - a. A title.
     - b. A legend.
     - c. Titles for both axes.
     - d. Values for both axes.
  3. Display the data in a table on the same form or page as the diagram. A data grid is recommended for this purpose.
  4. Allow interactive data modification with a mechanism to update the chart. Using a data grid (as recommended in point 3) for data entry is sufficient. Data validation for the data entry is not required.
  - **Note:** There is no need for a database or file for data storage. You may use hardcoded base data.

## Recommended Strategy
1. **Platform Selection:**
   - Choose the Microsoft platform that you are most comfortable with for this assignment.

2. **Control or Package Selection:**
   - You are free to use any controls or packages for generating the Pareto diagram, as long as it is implemented on the Windows platform using C#.
   - If using MS Chart, research how to use the chart control for the required view and data. A valuable resource is the Microsoft Chart Controls sample environment available at [msdn-code-gallery-community-s-z](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/msdn-code-gallery-community-s-z) under "Samples Environments for Microsoft Chart Controls."
   - The code samples are also available in a zip folder attached to this assignment. Note that the formatting in the tabs for C# and Visual Basic .NET source is not functional. You will need to refer to the source in the solution to understand chart implementation.

3. **Application of Knowledge:**
   - Utilize your skills and the resources provided to meet the assignment requirements.

### File Naming Requirements
- No specific file naming requirements are set. Names should be short but meaningful.

### Submission Requirements
- Submit the entire solution as a zip (compressed) folder in .zip or a compatible format.
